we only need to keep track of two basic things; patients and journals

a patient has a name, a responsible party, and a journal

a journal has all the information about a patient in dated entries

* personal (unlikely to change, favored contact method, SSN etc, can
  be created by patient)

* healthist (questionaire, can be created by patient)

* address

* phone

* email

* appointment (date, time, length, procedures, charge (calculated from
  fees?))

* txplan (list of procedures)

* insplan (company, contact information, free text "gotchas", anything
  else useful?)

* claim (insplan, appointment)

* payment (from patient or insurance, amount, refs to procedures?)

* progress (description of appointment, procedures, prognosis, etc)

* contact (record of a phone call or email exchange or etc)

* doc (scanned piece of paper)

in order to efficiently generate the journal display, each entry has a
summary recorded in the main "journal" table. then details can be
generated (when requested or needed, e.g. for "detailed" views or
printed reports) with another request to the appropriate table(s) for
additional information.

for simple entries of course all the information can be in the summary
(e.g. phone numbers, e-mails, addresses).
